cpp code implementation of mine of [this tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com)

structures, namings and some details are different because of personal habbits

not very good at cpp coding and English, learning slowly

the classes creation is mainly based on my own understanding of [High level Vulkan application flow](https://vkguide.dev/docs/introduction/vulkan_execution/#high-level-vulkan-application-flow)

for example

  VulkanInstance for Engine initialization

  RenderAssets for Asset initialization

  VertexRenderer for Render Loop, acutally i just want to name it Renderer.cc, but VertexRenderer.cc is better in case of auto-completion, i'm very lazy :D

so it might be wrong or unproper
